This is the source for my former personal website (made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and formatted with the [Minimal Mistakes template](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)).

See the source for my [current website](https:github.com/lcreteig/) instead.
