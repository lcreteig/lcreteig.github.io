I am a PhD student in the [Cognition and Plasticity lab of Heleen Slagter](https://www.heleenslagter.com), funded by an NWO Research Talent grant.

My research focuses on improving various forms of attention (but mostly spatial attention) through electrical brain stimulation (tDCS). I also have experience with EEG, eye tracking, and psychophysics.
